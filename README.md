# EM021-Wildfire

The design can be run with using codes in HPS_Software directory and following reference application's "PaaS Provision" tutorial. While creating "run_pythonapp.sh" adding "sleep 60" before the last line is recommended to give device time to configure FPGA fabric and allow nios2 processor program to run.
